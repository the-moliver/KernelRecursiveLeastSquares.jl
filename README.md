# KernelRecursiveLeastSquares

A Julia implementation of the Kernel Recursive Least Squares algorithm

KRLS is a fast and efficient online kernel regression algorithm. KRLS processes data one sample at a time and builds a dictionary of training points that are useful for approximating the function.
